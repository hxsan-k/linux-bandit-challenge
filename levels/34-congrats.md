# ðŸŽ‰ Congratulations!  

If youâ€™re reading this, it means youâ€™ve finished all the Bandit levels (which is no small achievement).

Along the way, youâ€™ve picked up real, practical skills:  
- Automating with Bash loops  
- Working with SSH keys and permissions  
- Digging into cron jobs and daemons  
- Exploring Git branches, tags, and history  
- Thinking creatively when the shell tries to trick you  

Some levels were straightforward, others forced you to slow down and try new approaches. 

Thatâ€™s the point - Bandit trains you to **adapt** when the usual tricks donâ€™t work.  

Finishing the game means you now have a solid foundation in Linux, scripting, and Git which are skills that will pay off in real-world scenarios.  

Thanks for following along with this walkthrough series.
