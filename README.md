# Linux Bandit Challenge Walkthrough 🐧

This repo contains my notes and solutions as I work through the OverTheWire Bandit wargame. The goal is to build practical Linux and command line skills from the ground up with no tech background.

## 📘 About the Challenge

Bandit is made up of a series of levels that get progressively harder. Each one teaches something new, from basic file navigation to more advanced Linux tools.

I’m aiming to complete the entire challenge, documenting each level as I go.
