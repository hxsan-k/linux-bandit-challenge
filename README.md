# Linux Bandit Challenge Walkthrough 🐧

This repo contains my notes and solutions as I work through the OverTheWire Bandit wargame. The goal is to build practical Linux and command line skills from the ground up with no tech background.

## 📘 About the Challenge

Bandit is made up of a series of levels that get progressively harder. Each one teaches something new, from basic file navigation to more advanced Linux tools.

I’m aiming to complete the entire challenge, documenting each level as I go.

## 🧠 New to Linux? Read This First  

### If you're thinking about taking on Bandit and you're brand new to Linux, here's some tips based on my experience so far:

- **Don’t panic** when the terminal looks empty, or and output looks confusing. That’s normal.
- **Use `man`, `--help`, or Google** to understand commands. You don’t need to memorise everything.
- **Get comfortable with the basics**: `ls`, `cd`, `cat`, `find`, `file`, and `grep` will take you far.
- **Make notes as you go.** When you finally crack the code with a command, make a note.
- **Try Ubuntu on WSL if you're on Windows** — it gives you a real Linux environment right inside Windows.

**Finally, before you start, I highly recommend watching this guide to mastering Linux man pages. It will be priceless throughout the challenge:**

## 🛠️ How to install WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux)

1. **Open PowerShell as Administrator**  
Right-click the Start menu and select Windows PowerShell "Run as Administrator”.

2. **Run this command:**
   ```powershell
   wsl --install

This installs WSL along with Ubuntu by default. It may prompt you to restart your computer.  

3. **Set Username & Password**  
After restarting, Ubuntu will launch automatically and ask you to create a username and password.

You’re now ready to start using Linux on Windows!
