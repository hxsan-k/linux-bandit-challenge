# Linux Bandit Challenge Walkthrough 🐧

This repo contains my notes and solutions as I work through the OverTheWire Bandit wargame. The goal is to build practical Linux and command line skills from the ground up with no tech background.

## 📘 About the Challenge

Bandit is made up of a series of levels that get progressively harder. Each one teaches something new, from basic file navigation to more advanced Linux tools.

I’m aiming to complete the entire challenge, documenting each level as I go.

## 🧠 New to Linux? Read This First

If you're thinking about taking on Bandit and you're brand new to Linux, I was there too just recently. 
Here's a few quick tips based on my experience so far:

- **Don’t panic** when the terminal looks empty or confusing. That’s normal.
- **Use `man`, `--help`, or Google** to understand commands. You don’t need to memorise everything.
- **Get comfortable with the basics**: `ls`, `cd`, `cat`, `find`, `file`, and `grep` will take you far.
- **Try Ubuntu on WSL** if you're on Windows, it’s a smooth way *(and probably the best way)* to get started.
- **Be curious.** If something doesn’t work, figure out *why* - that’s how you learn.

If you're considering it, want to talk about how I found it, or even need help just SSHing into the game for the first time, feel free to message me on LinkedIn!
