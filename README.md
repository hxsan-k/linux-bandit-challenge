# Linux Bandit Challenge Walkthrough 🐧

This repo contains my notes and solutions as I work through the OverTheWire Bandit wargame. The goal is to build practical Linux and command line skills from the ground up with no tech background.

## 📘 About the Challenge

Bandit is made up of a series of levels that get progressively harder. Each one teaches something new, from basic file navigation to more advanced Linux tools.

I’m aiming to complete the entire challenge, documenting each level as I go.

## 🧠 New to Linux? Read This First

If you're thinking about taking on Bandit and you're brand new to Linux, I was there too just recently. 
Here's a few quick tips based on my experience so far:

- **Don’t panic** when the terminal looks empty or confusing. That’s normal.
- **Use `man`, `--help`, or Google** to understand commands. You don’t need to memorise everything.
- **Get comfortable with the basics**: `ls`, `cd`, `cat`, `find`, `file`, and `grep` will take you far.
- **Be curious.** If something doesn’t work, figure out *why* - that’s how you learn. And finally,
- **Make notes as you go.** When you finally crack the code with a command, put it into a Word file
or note, or just make an entire GitHub repo like I did :)

>💡**Try Ubuntu on WSL if you're on Windows** — it gives you a real Linux environment right inside Windows, so you can run Linux commands and tools without needing a separate Linux machine.

## 🛠️ How to install WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux)

1. **Open PowerShell as Administrator**  
   Right-click the Start menu and select Windows PowerShell "Run as Administrator”.

2. **Run this command:**
   ```powershell
   wsl --install

This installs WSL along with Ubuntu by default. It may prompt you to restart your computer.  

3. **Set Username & Password**
After restarting, Ubuntu will launch automatically and ask you to create a username and password.

You’re now ready to start using Linux on Windows!

If you're considering the challenge, want to talk about how I found it, or even need help just SSHing into the game for the first time, feel free to message me on LinkedIn!
