# Linux Bandit Challenge Walkthrough üêß

This repo contains my notes, solutions, and lessons learned from completing the OverTheWire Bandit wargame. This project‚Äôs goal was to build practical Linux and command line skills from scratch, starting with no prior tech background, and to serve as a guide for anyone else beginning their journey into Linux fundamentals.  

By documenting each level, I‚Äôve aimed to make the solutions clear, reproducible, and beginner-friendly, while also highlighting the key concepts you pick up along the way.

## üìò About the Challenge  

- The goal of each level is to find the password (or key) that unlocks the next.  
- Passwords are usually long strings of characters, but some levels use `ssh` private keys instead.  
- Levels get progressively harder, covering everything from basic file navigation to more advanced Linux tools.  
- The challenge is hands-on and incremental, designed to build confidence step by step as the puzzles grow more complex.

## üìÅ What‚Äôs in This Repo  

- `levels/` ‚Äî contains all Bandit walkthroughs, one file per level.
- Each level write-up shows the step-by-step process I used to solve it.
- Before checking solutions, attempt the level on your own and use each step as a hint in the right direction.  
- The repo is organised so you can follow the progression of the challenge from start to finish.

## üß† New to Linux? Read This First  

- **Don‚Äôt panic** when the terminal looks empty, or when the output looks confusing. That‚Äôs normal.
- **Use `man`, `--help`, or Google** to understand commands and how to use them - you don‚Äôt need to memorise everything.
- **Get comfortable with the basics**: `ls`, `cd`, `cat`, `find`, `file`, and `grep` will take you far.
- **Remember to make a note of each password.**
- **Make notes on commands as you go.** When you finally crack the code with a command, type/write it down for memory.
- **Consider downloading Ubuntu on WSL if you're on Windows** - it gives you a real Linux environment right inside Windows.

**Finally, before you start, I highly recommend watching this guide to mastering Linux man pages. It will be invaluable throughout the challenge:**

## üõ†Ô∏è How to Install WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux)

**1. Open PowerShell as Administrator**  
- Right-click the Start menu, choose **Windows PowerShell**, and select **Run as Administrator**.

**2. Run the install command**  
   ```powershell
   wsl --install
   ```

- This will install WSL along with Ubuntu by default. You may be prompted to restart your computer.

**3. Set up your Linux user**

- After restarting, Ubuntu will launch automatically and ask you to create a username and password.

You‚Äôre now ready to start using Linux on Windows!
